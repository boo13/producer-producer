**Tech stack available:** CSS custom properties, flexbox, position: absolute for desktop collage
**Established patterns:** .window component, .desktop wrapper, decorative element positioning with absolute
**Constraining decisions:**
- Phase 1: Container margin replaced by .desktop flexbox centering
- Phase 4: Decorative elements use absolute positioning for desktop collage effect

**Issues being addressed:** None

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add rotation modifier classes</name>
  <files>css/styles.css</files>
  <action>Add CSS utility classes for tilted window effects after the .window-body rule (around line 92). Add:
- `.tilt-left` with `transform: rotate(-3deg)`
- `.tilt-right` with `transform: rotate(3deg)`
These modifiers can be combined with existing window components. Note: Some decorative elements already have inline rotation transforms (e.g., `.search-window` has `rotate(2deg)`). The modifiers provide standardized options for future use and consistency.</action>
  <verify>Classes exist in CSS and can be verified with `grep -n "tilt-left\|tilt-right" css/styles.css`</verify>
  <done>`.tilt-left` and `.tilt-right` classes defined with appropriate transforms</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create responsive mobile layout</name>
  <files>css/styles.css</files>
  <action>Replace the existing @media query (around line 450, currently max-width: 500px) with a comprehensive mobile breakpoint at 768px.

Mobile layout requirements (<768px):
1. Hide all decorative elements: `.folder-column`, `.search-window`, `.error-dialog`, `.speech-bubble`, `.media-player`, `.loading-bar` → `display: none`
2. Desktop wrapper: vertical stack with centered hero window
3. Hero window: full width, reduced padding
4. Keep existing hero window responsive adjustments (smaller title, description font)

The hero subscription form must remain fully visible and accessible on mobile. Only decorative (non-functional) elements are hidden to avoid clutter.</action>
  <verify>Browser dev tools at 767px width shows only hero window centered; decorative elements hidden. At 769px+ decorative elements visible.</verify>
  <done>Mobile breakpoint hides decorative elements, hero window remains centered and functional, no horizontal scroll</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Complete accessibility polish</name>
  <files>index.html</files>
  <action>Audit and improve ARIA labels on decorative elements:

Current state (already good):
- `.folder-column` has `role="presentation"` ✓
- `.search-window` has `role="presentation"` ✓
- `.error-dialog` has `role="dialog" aria-label="Decorative system error dialog"` ✓
- `.speech-bubble` has `role="presentation"` ✓
- `.media-player` has `role="presentation"` ✓
- `.loading-bar` has `role="presentation"` ✓

Add missing improvements:
1. Add `aria-label="Decorative search window"` to `.search-window` (has role but no label)
2. Add `aria-label="Decorative media player"` to `.media-player` (has role but no label)
3. Verify form maintains keyboard navigation (should already work - test tab order)

Do NOT change functional form elements or their accessibility - they work correctly with Buttondown integration.</action>
  <verify>Run axe-core audit in browser dev tools, or manual check: Tab through page confirms form inputs are focusable in correct order (email → submit button)</verify>
  <done>Decorative elements have appropriate ARIA labels, form keyboard navigation works, no accessibility warnings on decorative elements</done>
</task>
